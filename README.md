  🐶 AdoptGram App 🐱
</h1>

Hi! My name is Pietro and I'm the proud developer of this app ♥

AdoptGram is an "Instagram-like" app that have the purpose of connecting people with their local animal shelters/non-governamental-organizations, so they can adopt a new furry friend.

**📚 What about docs?**

Since I'm learning, I have not (yet) built a proper documentation with `Storybook`, but you can refer to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/vs0Bxt35Hjy3zihhLlrGlV/AdoptGram?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=89kr2eCgQuKMSbno-1) as the current "documentation". In the future I'll build the documentation for the project, don't worry :)
